# R---Website-Insight - Case Challenge 5

# Instruction
You are looking at data from an e-commerce website. The site is very simple and has just 4 pages:

The first page is the home page. When you come to the site for the first time, you can only land on the home page as a first page.

From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page.

From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, she will get to the payment page, where she is asked to provide payment information in order to buy that product.

If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the confirmation page


The company CEO isn't very happy with the volume of sales and, especially, of sales coming from new users. Therefore, she asked you to investigate whether there is something wrong in the conversion funnel or, in general, if you could suggest how conversion rate can be improved.

This project also fixed the annotation problem with non-stacked barchart and improved the data visualization from the reference site [https://www.kaggle.com/aerodinamicc/funnel-analysis-and-conversion-rates]
